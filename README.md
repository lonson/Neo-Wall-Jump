Introduction
------------
NeoWallJump is a game inspired from Super Metroid + Matrix made during the GlobalJam 2018 in Toronto. It is simple game made using JavaScript, the framework Pixi.js and a P2 engine. The objective of the game is to get to the top of the wall through wall-jumps while avoiding the falling objects. To perform a wall-jump, you have to time the jump key (up button) correctly with the proper sprite animation frame. To move left/right, use the arrow keys. The theme music was inspired from the track Clubbed To Death from the The Original Matrix Movie.
